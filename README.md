# Network-Analysis-using-Wireshark


### 🌐 Introduction to Network Analysis and Wireshark

Network Analysis is the process of monitoring, capturing, and examining network traffic to understand how data flows across systems. It is a critical skill for cybersecurity, system administration, and troubleshooting, as it helps detect performance issues, misconfigurations, or even malicious activities.

One of the most widely used tools for this purpose is Wireshark.

 🔹 It is an open-source network protocol analyzer.
 🔹 Allows you to capture live traffic or load packet capture (PCAP) files.
 🔹 Provides deep visibility into network protocols, packets, and communication patterns.
 🔹 Commonly used by SOC analysts, network engineers, and penetration testers for:

   🔰Incident investigation
   🔰Malware and threat analysis
   🔰Protocol troubleshooting
   🔰Detecting suspicious activity like DNS tunneling or beaconing

In short, Wireshark turns raw network traffic into readable, analyzable data, making it an essential tool for anyone working in cybersecurity or IT.
