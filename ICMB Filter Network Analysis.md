## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to introduce Wireshark for packet analysis. As SOC analysts use it to investigate network traffic, this exercise focuses on learning the interface, capturing packets, applying filters, and identifying suspicious communication patterns.


## 🛠️ Lab Setup

### Environment

 Operating System: Kali Linux (Wireshark is pre-installed, so no extra setup required)
 Network Adapter: Needed for live packet capture

### Resources

 [Wireshark (latest version)](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
 [Sample PCAP file]



## ▶️ Lab Steps

1. Launch Wireshark on Kali Linux.
2. Load the sample PCAP file instead of capturing live traffic at first.
3. Create a new profile named “SOC Analyst.”
4. Practice with filters:

    Display filter: Show only ICMP traffic.
    Capture filter: Capture only ICMP traffic.
5. Explore the captured packets and note suspicious communication patterns.


## 📘 Key Learnings

 -Wireshark provides visibility into how data flows across a network.
 -Filters help focus on specific traffic types like ICMP, DNS, or HTTP.
 -Useful for incident investigation, malware analysis, and threat hunting.
